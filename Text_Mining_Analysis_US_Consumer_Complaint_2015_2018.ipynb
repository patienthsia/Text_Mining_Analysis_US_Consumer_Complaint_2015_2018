       "      <td>I have been a loyal customer of Citibank, and a Citigold member for years. On XXXX XXXX, funds in several of my accounts had been frozen, due to a name mismatch of the payee. The initial instructions given by the XXXX representative who contacted me were not accurate, as they asked me to bring a co-signor to the branch. The next morning, upon our arrival, I was told that my business partner could not co-sign because my account is frozen. If this was the case, why was this even presented as a solution to rectify the situation? My partner spent a workday in the bank with me and was n't even needed or able to assist in a viable solution. On XXXX/XXXX/16, after much time and effort, due to having to acquire a notarized affidavit, he completed and faxed an affidavit and was told that it would be resolved between 24-48 hours. As of XXXX XXXX, my account is still frozen. XXXX does not accept calls, and employees I contacted were increasingly rude and unhelpful, I resorted to tweeting XXXX, who discovered that the details from the fax were too dark to read. I do not understand why this was not communicated in a timely manner and that I had to inquire after waiting an extended period of time. Clearly, faxing is not the best way to send this information- they should have provided other options to send the affidavit and ensure a timely resolution. I now know that payments that came into my account had more than one name attached to them, and that to access my funds I will need each of these other persons to sign and send an affidavit. This is not a viable solution as the nature of my business makes this a nearly impossible feat. Because the bank allowed this to continue without issue for many months I was unaware there was an issue. I work with individuals across the United States and with many, I do not have a personal relationship simply a business relationship or contact. Obtaining an affidavit from each individual would be an enormous undertaking as these affidavits would have to be completed during regular business hours, due to the notarization requirement, and no compensation for the loss of time is available. \\r\\n\\r\\nI hold the opinion that I should have been privy to this information from the start. Since I previously had no issue with receiving payment in this manner for months, I had absolutely no idea what was happening, nor did I suspect that the outcome would leave me unable to access my funds, not only my earnings but those used to pay necessary associated business and living expenses. This is a systematic error and to freeze so many months of repeated payments at the click of a button, is unfair to the client especially when there is no viable solution and the institution is inflexible. This is a contrived issue as no court order was issued, no judgment rendered, nor fraud reported by any of the other named payees. I should have been told of any issues with my account from day one! As of the date of this complaint, the account is still frozen. I am both incredibly frustrated with the system, as well as with the staff of Citibank. On a number of occasions, the staff of Citibank was rude and provided misinformation in regard to courses of action. They repeatedly encouraged me to admit culpability for a situation that they created due to speculation instead of facts. Their conduct has made this terrible experience even worse. In many instances I had to call them, go into the bank, and go on twitter just to find out that there were problems that they had n't told me. I do not know when or if my account will be unfrozen, and can not access any of the money I 've worked so incredibly hard for. Their behavior is not only unethical but unconscionable and I respectfully request an investigation into their conduct and that you advocate for the rights of consumers like myself who have their money held hostage without sound reason</td>\n",

A few years later I received a letter from Citi saying my XXXX promotion would end and a min. balance fee would apply to my acct. I was given a year before these changes would take effect. In XX/XX/XXXX, well before the Fed promotion was to end, I removed my money from the Citi acct, depositing it into a different bank acct ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). Having withdrawn all my money from my Citi account, I logged into my Citibank.com acct to send a message requesting to close my acct. I used the internal Citi messaging system. I received a message in return explaining what I needed to do in order for my acct to close : to reply to that message with a couple additional details. I was told, having done that, my acct would be closed. I did exactly what they told me to. XX/XX/XXXX I received a fraud alert from Citi. At this point I was well under the impression my acct did n't exist. The alert let me know that Citi did not close my acct as requested and now it was being subjected to fraud attempts. I logged into my online acct. I found my acct was fully active and was being charged fees. The Fed promotion had expired and since my acct had n't been closed ( despite what I was told ) my balance of {$0.00} was being assessed min. balance fees. Along with that the Checking Plus over draft protection was kicking in to cover those fees -- those fees on an acct I was under the impression was closed. I noticed then that there was another message in my Citi message center. In short it said : whoops, we made a mistake, we actually need you to send this other response in order to close your acct. I received no phone call or e-mail. The ONLY effort they made to tell me they gave me incorrect information on how to close my acct was to send a message to the message center of the act I had been told was closed. \\r\\nI call Citi. I explained the scenario to a customer service rep ( CSR ) who forwarded me on to his supervisor. I spoke with the supervisor for a substantial amount of time. He assured me he would take care of this mishap personally and immediately. I was told the account would be put back in order and closed immediately. XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from XXXX XXXX Director Citibank N.A., asking me to pay the fees due on my acct -- the acct I had now closed TWICE. I call Citi on XX/XX/XXXX. I speak to a collections rep named XXXX who forwarded me to a CSR named XXXX. XXXX explained to me the steps needed in order to close the acct:1 ) Citi would waive the fees assessed on my acct2 ) Citi would refund the those fees back to the checking acct3 ) Citi would transfer the new balance of the checking acct into the checking plus acct, in order to get it back to its original {$100.00} and Citi would close the accts. \\r\\nHowever, XXXX only had permission to correct {$70.00}. She said her supervisor could take care of the rest. At this point XXXX goes back and forth a while talking to her supervisor while I stay on hold. She says that they were able to waive the fees and refund the checking acct the full amount that would be necessary to bring the checking plus balance up to {$100.00}. However, the checking acct and the checking plus acct were no longer connected to each other and the funds could n't be transferred.

Roughly once a month, I do a wire transfer from the Citi account to my XXXX bank account ( XXXX ), because I work in XXXX for an American company. I long ago set up a wire-transfer model/template on Citi 's website so I do n't have to constantly reenter the beneficiary bank information, which never changes. This process had worked seamlessly dozens, perhaps hundreds, of times. Then, on XXXX XXXX, 2016, I executed a wire transfer for {$10000.00}. ( Based on an exchange rate of about {$1.00} per pound, this would have converted into approximately XXXX XXXX. ) A week later, the money had n't arrived in my XXXX account. So I called Citi. They confirmed that the wire had been properly executed and said they 'd look into why I had n't received the money yet. They said that, upon resolution, if there turned out to have been a mistake, I had the choice of either having the {$10000.00} reinstated into my Citi account or having the equivalent in pounds transferred to the beneficiary account. By then I had arranged for an alternate source of money to be transferred to my XXXX account, so I told Citi that I would like to have the {$10000.00} returned. A few days later, around XXXX XXXX, having heard nothing from Citi, I called back. This time, they suggested that I amend my XXXX XXXX wire transfer to include an XXXX number. ( I 'd never included this before, because Citi 's template only requested a sort code, account number, and bank mailing address, and the process had always worked smoothly. ) I provided the XXXX over the phone and was told the transfer would now be executed. \\r\\n\\r\\nTwo weeks later ( and four weeks after my original wire transfer ), on XXXX XXXX, I received notification from Citi that the transfer had been unsuccessful and they could either resubmit it again or refund the money. The catch was that the money had already been converted into pounds and, because of the steep devaluation of the XXXX due to XXXX, Citi would only refund {$9200.00} to my account. In other words, I would be stuck with a loss of roughly {$800.00}. A string of supervisors at Citi refused to budge, saying I had no other options. \\r\\n\\r\\nI still do not know what caused the wire transfer to not reach its intended destination, but I do know that it was not my fault. I used the same information for the beneficiary account that I have used dozens of times in the past, and ( since it is my own personal account ) I know that the information was and remains correct.

On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I made a deposit of {$51000.00} into my new Checking in their XXXX XXXX branch and the deposit of {$51000.00} was soon shown in my online account page. \\r\\nOn XXXX XXXX, 2015 when I randomly browse my online Citi bank account, shockingly I found that the balance became XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2015 through Teller Withdrawal, which I did not authorize. After I contacted Citibank customer service, I was informed that my account was closed by bank end department and they authorized the withdrawal and a cashier check was sent to me. I was directed to New Account Servicing for the explanation of the closing of my account. I was told that it was due to an error on my signed signature card. While identifying myself as the primary owner of the account and sign it, I accidentally checked a box for additional user and signed my name next to it. I was told because of this error, my account was closed. \\r\\nI need to point out that I mailed the signed signature card on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and made the deposit on XXXX XXXX, 2015. In other words, the signed signature card should have already arrived before I made the deposit. But I was not notified any problem with my account when I made the deposit. One may debate that their New Account Servicing does not review signed signature cards that fast. I understand if it may take several more days. However, it took them 25 days to identify the error. \\r\\nOne may also debate that I need to wait until my signed signature card is approved before I made the deposit. Their {$400.00} promotion requires that I need to make an eligible deposit of {$50000.00} or more into my new Checking or new within 30 days after account opening. My account open on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and their identified the error on the signed signature card on XXXX XXXX, 2015, which is after 30 days. I would have missed the promotion window. In addition, in their welcome package, they did not specify I should wait until my signed signature card is approved before I made the deposit. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy point is that since the {$400.00} promotion requires 1 ) Open a new consumer Checking Account in The Citigold Account Package by XXXX/XXXX/2015. 2 ) Make an eligible deposit of {$50000.00} into their new Checking account within 30 days after account opening ; 3 ) maintain a minimum of {$50000.00} for the next 30 days to receive their bonus, I satisfied the first XXXX requirements. I do not satisfy the third requirement by 5 days because they took the liberty to close my account. This action makes me suspect that they close the account deliberately right before I satisfied the third requirement in order to avoid paying the {$400.00} cash back which I deserve. It also reminds me of the so called error that I made on the signature card. If I checked an extra box, I put my signature there, not somebody else. What problem does that constitute? Even if my error voids the signature card, they could have contacted me and send me another card to sign. How does that cause the close of the account? Even if they need to close my account, why did they keep my money so long? I also read on the internet that there are similar cases occurring with their Citi gold promotion, which make me suspect that they use this as a strategy to avoid pay {$400.00} cash back.</td>\n",

( recall the check was cashed on XXXX XXXX, and I have called twice in XXXX to ask stop the old check and send a new one ) 3 ) Some people in Customer Service is not professional at all with that kind of remarks and tone. \\r\\n4 ) Citibank has huge security flaw, how can the fund with amount of $ XXXX be released without the check being signed with ID verification? \\r\\n5 ) It should be so easy for citibank to follow through this check and see where/who has cashed it. yet, now instead they want me to prove to them I did not cash it by post mail me the Affidavit, which could take at least another week to arrive. \\r\\nWhat bureaucracy is this?</td>\n",

I 'm also attaching that letter here. They are as much responsible for not ensuring such a fraudulent use of other people 's account and for failing to correct this appropriately given the evidence that these are fraudulent transactions. \\r\\nWhether there is a 60 day dispute window or not, such should not be an excuse to avoid correcting what truly are unauthorized transactions. What this incident implies is that we can not completely rely on banks to keep our monies safe without us having to check on it from time to time.

First and foremost, I have what was supposed to be a free checking account that I 've held for almost fifteen years without incident, but now almost never use. There appears to be many fees from Citibank attached to this so-called free checking account that I do not understand. Furthermore, when the account for some reason despite almost never being used became overdrawn, perhaps in part due to these mystery fees from Citibank, Citibank did NOT notify me. Instead, they allowed my overdraft account to become totally exhausted, in order to charge me additional interest and fees on the account, that much is clear, but rather than call me when this occurred, they sent me a letter which looked like an ordinary statement rather than call me. Citibank has claimed in said letter that they no longer have my contact information, even though none of it has changed in over ten years. This is either false on the part of Citibank, or it shows extreme incompetence in terms of their record keeping. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe most egregious part, is that even though I sent a certified letter to my branch begging them to please call me to answer my questions, they have ignored my request and instead reported my as DELINQUENT to the major credit bureaus. Without one phone call, and I have banked there for almost 15 years! I have very good credit, pay my bills on time, and have never been delinquent on a payment in my life, yet Citibank who I believe has a lot of explaining to do to ME in terms of this account has RUINED my hard earned credit. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis should not be allowed to happen. They should be investigated and they should provide me with the answers I am seeking. I can only wonder how many others may be getting treated like this by a major financial institution who seems to think they have no accountability whatsoever to their customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nRegards, XXXX</td>\n",

Why I have to go through all this because of you unprofessional act? In one day I lost all my life savings. \\r\\nPlease help me to get my money back. \\r\\nThis is USA and in this country no one can treat consumers and tax payers like that. \\r\\nThey disrespecting us and discriminating without any reason.</td>\n",

       "16827    I have been a loyal customer of Citibank, and a Citigold member for years. On XXXX XXXX, funds in several of my accounts had been frozen, due to a name mismatch of the payee. The initial instructions given by the XXXX representative who contacted me were not accurate, as they asked me to bring a co-signor to the branch. The next morning, upon our arrival, I was told that my business partner could not co-sign because my account is frozen. If this was the case, why was this even presented as a solution to rectify the situation? My partner spent a workday in the bank with me and was n't even needed or able to assist in a viable solution. On XXXX/XXXX/16, after much time and effort, due to having to acquire a notarized affidavit, he completed and faxed an affidavit and was told that it would be resolved between 24-48 hours. As of XXXX XXXX, my account is still frozen. XXXX does not accept calls, and employees I contacted were increasingly rude and unhelpful, I resorted to tweeting XXXX, who discovered that the details from the fax were too dark to read. I do not understand why this was not communicated in a timely manner and that I had to inquire after waiting an extended period of time. Clearly, faxing is not the best way to send this information- they should have provided other options to send the affidavit and ensure a timely resolution. I now know that payments that came into my account had more than one name attached to them, and that to access my funds I will need each of these other persons to sign and send an affidavit. This is not a viable solution as the nature of my business makes this a nearly impossible feat. Because the bank allowed this to continue without issue for many months I was unaware there was an issue. I work with individuals across the United States and with many, I do not have a personal relationship simply a business relationship or contact. Obtaining an affidavit from each individual would be an enormous undertaking as these affidavits would have to be completed during regular business hours, due to the notarization requirement, and no compensation for the loss of time is available. \\r\\n\\r\\nI hold the opinion that I should have been privy to this information from the start. Since I previously had no issue with receiving payment in this manner for months, I had absolutely no idea what was happening, nor did I suspect that the outcome would leave me unable to access my funds, not only my earnings but those used to pay necessary associated business and living expenses. This is a systematic error and to freeze so many months of repeated payments at the click of a button, is unfair to the client especially when there is no viable solution and the institution is inflexible. This is a contrived issue as no court order was issued, no judgment rendered, nor fraud reported by any of the other named payees. I should have been told of any issues with my account from day one! As of the date of this complaint, the account is still frozen. I am both incredibly frustrated with the system, as well as with the staff of Citibank. On a number of occasions, the staff of Citibank was rude and provided misinformation in regard to courses of action. They repeatedly encouraged me to admit culpability for a situation that they created due to speculation instead of facts. Their conduct has made this terrible experience even worse. In many instances I had to call them, go into the bank, and go on twitter just to find out that there were problems that they had n't told me. I do not know when or if my account will be unfrozen, and can not access any of the money I 've worked so incredibly hard for. Their behavior is not only unethical but unconscionable and I respectfully request an investigation into their conduct and that you advocate for the rights of consumers like myself who have their money held hostage without sound reason                                                                                                                \n",
       "18228    I am writing a serious complaint against Citibank, I had been banking with them about four years and my accounts have always been positive and properly funded. I noticed about three weeks ago the bank started making unauthorized bank credits and debits on my account. That now have my checking account seriously delinquent. When my account is definitely suppose to be positive. The bank has acknowledged these errors and as you can see on the banking printout they reimbursed XXXX {$10.00} transfer fees and XXXX NSF fee. I went to the bank about these errors the banking representative XXXX XXXX XXXX stated that these are the worse banking errors he has ever seen. It 's like the bank just went in my account and went crazy removing my money. No one at Citibank has been able to explain why so many banking errors on my account. I am hereby requesting that a complete audit be done on my Savings and Checking and my account be bought back positive. These banking errors have ruin me financially. I had to immediately close all my accounts. My government direct deposit had been going their for years, so now I am left without a paycheck until this is resolved. I ca n't pay my mortgage, utility bills, credit bills or nothing. This has ruin me. I do n't know why the bank did this to me. It 's like they deliberately sabotage my account. Please help me resolve this. The bank has been very unsympathetic. Now my account is overdrawn over {$4000.00} after getting a {$2300.00} direct deposit. That the bank has kept and refused to give me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "232873   Citibank took {$170.00} in fees from my checking account between XXXX XXXX, 2015 to XXXX XXXX, 2015. In order to maximize the fees, Citibank processed larger transactions first in my checking account then smaller transactions which caused my account to be overdrafted. Citibank is engaging in unfair business practices by processing larger transactions first then smaller transactions in order to maximize overdraft fees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "232913   XX/XX/XXXX I opened a bank acct with Citibank ( Citi ). A few years later I received a letter from Citi saying my XXXX promotion would end and a min. balance fee would apply to my acct. I was given a year before these changes would take effect. In XX/XX/XXXX, well before the Fed promotion was to end, I removed my money from the Citi acct, depositing it into a different bank acct ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). Having withdrawn all my money from my Citi account, I logged into my Citibank.com acct to send a message requesting to close my acct. I used the internal Citi messaging system. I received a message in return explaining what I needed to do in order for my acct to close : to reply to that message with a couple additional details. I was told, having done that, my acct would be closed. I did exactly what they told me to. XX/XX/XXXX I received a fraud alert from Citi. At this point I was well under the impression my acct did n't exist. The alert let me know that Citi did not close my acct as requested and now it was being subjected to fraud attempts. I logged into my online acct. I found my acct was fully active and was being charged fees. The Fed promotion had expired and since my acct had n't been closed ( despite what I was told ) my balance of {$0.00} was being assessed min. balance fees. Along with that the Checking Plus over draft protection was kicking in to cover those fees -- those fees on an acct I was under the impression was closed. I noticed then that there was another message in my Citi message center. In short it said : whoops, we made a mistake, we actually need you to send this other response in order to close your acct. I received no phone call or e-mail. The ONLY effort they made to tell me they gave me incorrect information on how to close my acct was to send a message to the message center of the act I had been told was closed. \\r\\nI call Citi. I explained the scenario to a customer service rep ( CSR ) who forwarded me on to his supervisor. I spoke with the supervisor for a substantial amount of time. He assured me he would take care of this mishap personally and immediately. I was told the account would be put back in order and closed immediately. XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from XXXX XXXX Director Citibank N.A., asking me to pay the fees due on my acct -- the acct I had now closed TWICE. I call Citi on XX/XX/XXXX. I speak to a collections rep named XXXX who forwarded me to a CSR named XXXX. XXXX explained to me the steps needed in order to close the acct:1 ) Citi would waive the fees assessed on my acct2 ) Citi would refund the those fees back to the checking acct3 ) Citi would transfer the new balance of the checking acct into the checking plus acct, in order to get it back to its original {$100.00} and Citi would close the accts. \\r\\nHowever, XXXX only had permission to correct {$70.00}. She said her supervisor could take care of the rest. At this point XXXX goes back and forth a while talking to her supervisor while I stay on hold. She says that they were able to waive the fees and refund the checking acct the full amount that would be necessary to bring the checking plus balance up to {$100.00}. However, the checking acct and the checking plus acct were no longer connected to each other and the funds could n't be transferred. The XXXX accts were disconnected when the debit card was reported stolen sometime after I thought the account was closed. XXXX says I can take care of this today if I go to a branch. There are no Citi branches within XXXX miles of me. XXXX transfers me to her supervisor ( XXXX, pronounced XXXX, employee ID XXXX ). XXXX laughs at me several times, refuses to transfer me to her supervisor, and finally promises to fix everything and call me XX/XX/XXXX She would not give me a way to contact her. She never called. I sent a letter to Citi. No response. And now Citi 's collections office is calling again ...                                                                                         \n",
       "239329   For more than six years, I have had a Citibank account. Roughly once a month, I do a wire transfer from the Citi account to my XXXX bank account ( XXXX ), because I work in XXXX for an American company. I long ago set up a wire-transfer model/template on Citi 's website so I do n't have to constantly reenter the beneficiary bank information, which never changes. This process had worked seamlessly dozens, perhaps hundreds, of times. Then, on XXXX XXXX, 2016, I executed a wire transfer for {$10000.00}. ( Based on an exchange rate of about {$1.00} per pound, this would have converted into approximately XXXX XXXX. ) A week later, the money had n't arrived in my XXXX account. So I called Citi. They confirmed that the wire had been properly executed and said they 'd look into why I had n't received the money yet. They said that, upon resolution, if there turned out to have been a mistake, I had the choice of either having the {$10000.00} reinstated into my Citi account or having the equivalent in pounds transferred to the beneficiary account. By then I had arranged for an alternate source of money to be transferred to my XXXX account, so I told Citi that I would like to have the {$10000.00} returned. A few days later, around XXXX XXXX, having heard nothing from Citi, I called back. This time, they suggested that I amend my XXXX XXXX wire transfer to include an XXXX number. ( I 'd never included this before, because Citi 's template only requested a sort code, account number, and bank mailing address, and the process had always worked smoothly. ) I provided the XXXX over the phone and was told the transfer would now be executed. \\r\\n\\r\\nTwo weeks later ( and four weeks after my original wire transfer ), on XXXX XXXX, I received notification from Citi that the transfer had been unsuccessful and they could either resubmit it again or refund the money. The catch was that the money had already been converted into pounds and, because of the steep devaluation of the XXXX due to XXXX, Citi would only refund {$9200.00} to my account. In other words, I would be stuck with a loss of roughly {$800.00}. A string of supervisors at Citi refused to budge, saying I had no other options. \\r\\n\\r\\nI still do not know what caused the wire transfer to not reach its intended destination, but I do know that it was not my fault. I used the same information for the beneficiary account that I have used dozens of times in the past, and ( since it is my own personal account ) I know that the information was and remains correct. It seems grossly unfair for me to suffer a huge loss due to someone else 's mistake. Please help!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

At this point, Citibank has already charged me {$60.00} in fees to my account as I waited for the promotional miles to be placed on my account until I recently followed up and was told that I did not qualify for the offer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "239387   In XX/XX/XXXX received a targeted promotion from Citibank, offering me XXXX American Airlines miles as a bonus for opening a Citigold checking account and completing simple requirements.

       "240487   I have a checking account at Citibank. When I wrote a check of {$1000.00} to XXXX XXXX for paying my rent ( for my wife, XXXX XXXX 's rent in XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX, somebody named XXXX XXXX, instead of XXXX XXXX, cashed the check to her own Citibank account by wiping out the recipient 's name ( XXXX XXXX ) and put her name on the check. Citibank did not look carefully for the payee authenticity and paid the money to that person ( XXXX XXXX ). \\r\\nI filed a clam to Citibank for {$1000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. Citibank Representative in that office told me that the check was deposited in a Citibank account, i would be easy for them to find the theft since they videotaped every ATM transaction. They would open an investigation and pay me back in 3 months. But The denied my claim on XX/XX/XXXX using the reason that I did not report the case within 30 days from the incident happening. \\r\\nIf the consumer put his money in that bank and the bank can not make sure that the written check is going to pay the person the account owner put on, there is no safety the bank can provide to the consumer. Citibank only allow 30 days to claim the loss from money theft. That time is too short and consumer can not find out what has happen in such a short time period. The unpaid rent to XXXX XXXX caused a lot of troubles to my whole family including the damage to my wife 's credit record and we are the innocent victims of the bank money stealing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "240494   Complaint : Citigold checking account service denying my {$400.00} Cash Bonus On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I open a Citibank 's Citigold checking to earn {$400.00} Cash Bonus with promotion code XXXX through XXXX. The promotion requires 1 ) Open a new consumer Checking Account in The Citigold Account Package by XXXX/XXXX/2015. 2 ) Make an eligible deposit of {$50000.00} or more in new-to-Citibank ( R ) funds into their new Checking or new or existing Savings Plus account within 30 days after account opening. 3 ) Maintain a minimum of {$50000.00} for the next 30 days to receive their bonus. \\r\\nI received the welcome package on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and mailed the signed signature card back to them on XXXX XXXX, 2015. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I made a deposit of {$51000.00} into my new Checking in their XXXX XXXX branch and the deposit of {$51000.00} was soon shown in my online account page. \\r\\nOn XXXX XXXX, 2015 when I randomly browse my online Citi bank account, shockingly I found that the balance became XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2015 through Teller Withdrawal, which I did not authorize. After I contacted Citibank customer service, I was informed that my account was closed by bank end department and they authorized the withdrawal and a cashier check was sent to me. I was directed to New Account Servicing for the explanation of the closing of my account. I was told that it was due to an error on my signed signature card. While identifying myself as the primary owner of the account and sign it, I accidentally checked a box for additional user and signed my name next to it. I was told because of this error, my account was closed. \\r\\nI need to point out that I mailed the signed signature card on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and made the deposit on XXXX XXXX, 2015. In other words, the signed signature card should have already arrived before I made the deposit. But I was not notified any problem with my account when I made the deposit. One may debate that their New Account Servicing does not review signed signature cards that fast. I understand if it may take several more days. However, it took them 25 days to identify the error. \\r\\nOne may also debate that I need to wait until my signed signature card is approved before I made the deposit. Their {$400.00} promotion requires that I need to make an eligible deposit of {$50000.00} or more into my new Checking or new within 30 days after account opening. My account open on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and their identified the error on the signed signature card on XXXX XXXX, 2015, which is after 30 days. I would have missed the promotion window. In addition, in their welcome package, they did not specify I should wait until my signed signature card is approved before I made the deposit. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy point is that since the {$400.00} promotion requires 1 ) Open a new consumer Checking Account in The Citigold Account Package by XXXX/XXXX/2015. 2 ) Make an eligible deposit of {$50000.00} into their new Checking account within 30 days after account opening ; 3 ) maintain a minimum of {$50000.00} for the next 30 days to receive their bonus, I satisfied the first XXXX requirements. I do not satisfy the third requirement by 5 days because they took the liberty to close my account. This action makes me suspect that they close the account deliberately right before I satisfied the third requirement in order to avoid paying the {$400.00} cash back which I deserve. It also reminds me of the so called error that I made on the signature card. If I checked an extra box, I put my signature there, not somebody else. What problem does that constitute? Even if my error voids the signature card, they could have contacted me and send me another card to sign. How does that cause the close of the account? Even if they need to close my account, why did they keep my money so long? I also read on the internet that there are similar cases occurring with their Citi gold promotion, which make me suspect that they use this as a strategy to avoid pay {$400.00} cash back.   \n",
       "240543   On XX/XX/2016, I applied for a Citibank Gitigold Interest Checking Account with a XXXX promotional offer ( XXXX ). The offer was sent to a friend - not to me. I mentioned that detail to the account representative at the time that I opened the account and was told that I still qualified for the offer. I completed the promotional requirements by XX/XX/XXXX and waited 90 days for the points to post. When the points did not appear in my account, I sent a message to Citibank to confirm that I would be receiving the points. Citibank opened an investigation and determined that there was not ThankYou ( R ) Points promotion offered in conjunction with the opening of my account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted their customer service department and spoke to a representative who told me the same thing. \\r\\n\\r\\nI understand that Citibank wants to limit promotional offers to targeted customers, but when I mentioned that I did not directly receive the promotional offer at the time I opened the account, I was not informed that I did n't qualify. Further, I did not receive any disclosure in the account opening documents or over the phone that indicated that certain individuals could not qualify for the offer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "240544   I applied the Citigold checking account XXXX XXXX by signing up for its promotion offer - a bonus of XXXX miles upon fulfilling its requirements. \\r\\n\\r\\n1. One day after I opened the account, I called Citigold customer service, the rep confirmed that I was indeed signed up for the promotion. \\r\\n2. In XXXX XXXX, upon completing the requirements for the promotion, I emailed Citigold customer service again. I soon received the following confirmation email that I indeed completed all requirements. \\r\\n\\r\\n\" From : XXXX XXXX XXXX Date : XXXX Account Number : Interest Checking XXXX Subject : Re : Promotional Offer Reference : XXXX Dear XXXX XXXX, Welcome to Citigold, my name is XXXX. It would be my pleasure to review your promotion completion status. \\r\\n\\r\\nI am glad to confirm that you have completed all requirements for offer code XXXX and the XXXX bonus miles will be credited by Citibank to your XXXX account within 90 days from the end of the statement period in which you complete all offer requirements. Your 90 day waiting period will begin at the end of XXXX. Please keep in mind this waiting period is standard for all promotions and can not be waived. \" However, five months later, I contacted the customer service again asking why no miles were posted to my account. I was told that I ca n't get the miles because I was not on their initial target list. \\r\\n\\r\\nI said I would be OK with the new decision if Citibank was willing to refund me the {$60.00} Citigold service fee I was recently charged. I would have not opened the Citigold and paid the fee if it was not for the multiple confirmations from their customer service. \\r\\n\\r\\nCitibank replied with refusal to refund the fee, and re-affirmed the refusal to honor the promotion I signed up for, despite what their reps confirmed in the past.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "240564   After citibank pulled out of MA, I called the customer support line to have my account closed and mail me the check on XXXX XXXX, 2016. I was told that would take 5-7 business days. However, after 2 weeks not receiving the check, I called again on XXXX XXXX, I was told check was mailed out on XXXX XXXX, but they mailed to my old address, which I do n't understand because I have been receiving citibank statements in my new address for a few months already. I asked them to stop the old check and reissue me a new XXXX to my new address, which I gave to them over the phone. They said ok. However, after two weeks, I still have not received it, so I called again on XXXX XXXX, asking them to stop the old check and re-issue me a new one to my new address. I have to give them my new address one more time over the phone, since their database still seemed to have just the old one. Again, they asked me to wait for 5-7 Business days. Still no check, so I called again on XXXX XXXX, repeat the same thing, being told the same. Again, on XXXX XXXX, I called, repeated the same thing again, being told the same again. However, on XXXX XXXX, when I called again, I was told, \" we have sent you the check on XXXX XXXX, and you have cashed it on XXXX XXXX ''. I said I never received the check, how can I have cashed it? then the person said, \" well, if you have not cashed it, you will need to prove to us you did not cash it ''. That made me really mad. \\r\\nWhat kind of customer service is that? \\r\\nI have been calling so many times, saying I have not received the check, now you are saying I have actually cashed the check? \\r\\nI asked them to send me a copy of the check, which they did. \\r\\nThe check was not signed. \\r\\nHow could citibank release fund when the check was not signed? I asked. \\r\\nthe person said, \" well, if that was your own account, we did not require you to sign it to cash it. \" How ridiculous is this? \\r\\nNow they have handed me over to their Dispute Department, because it was a \" dispute amount '' according to them. \\r\\nI think there are so many mistakes they have made : 1 ) Sent the check to my old address while my statements are sent to my new address. why they did not check my most-up-date address while issuing the check? \\r\\n2 ) customer service is not doing their job at all, as there was plenty time to stop the check. ( recall the check was cashed on XXXX XXXX, and I have called twice in XXXX to ask stop the old check and send a new one ) 3 ) Some people in Customer Service is not professional at all with that kind of remarks and tone. \\r\\n4 ) Citibank has huge security flaw, how can the fund with amount of $ XXXX be released without the check being signed with ID verification? \\r\\n5 ) It should be so easy for citibank to follow through this check and see where/who has cashed it. yet, now instead they want me to prove to them I did not cash it by post mail me the Affidavit, which could take at least another week to arrive. \\r\\nWhat bureaucracy is this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "240565   Hello, After receiving a promotional offer code for a Citibank checking account that would earn a XXXX XXXX mile bonus after meeting a few requirements, I signed up for an account using the code on XXXX/XXXX/2016. \\r\\n\\r\\nI then confirmed with a Citibank representative in XX/XX/XXXX that I had met the requirements and would be receiving the bonus. On XXXX/XXXX/2016 I received a message from Citibank saying that I did meet the requirement and would receive the miles in XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX at the latest. I have a copy of this message as proof. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen XX/XX/XXXX came I received no miles, I sent a message to Citibank to check in. At this point Citibank said that, even though I had previously been told I would get the miles, I was not actually eligible for the bonus and so would not be receiving the miles. This seems to me to be blatant, false advertising. I would like the XXXX miles that I was promised and my {$60.00} in fees paid while I waited refunded. \\r\\n\\r\\nThank you for your time and help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "240570   Opened a new Citibank Checking account on XX/XX/XXXX with a promotion code to receive a {$400.00} cash bonus within 90 days of the date that all requirements were met. I met all the requirements and should have received the payment on XX/XX/XXXX. Spoke to citibank representatives multiple times after that date and was told my bonus was being investigated. As of XX/XX/XXXX, was told that the investigation might take up to 60 more additional days to be resolved. Was also told that closing my account and withdrawing my current balance could make me illegible for the bonus. Citibank seems to be clearly stalling payment that is due to many of the customers that signed up for this promotion. By breaking the agreement to pay within 90 days, I believe that this is clearly fraudulent marketing practices and should be investigated as it may be effecting thousands of consumers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "240586   Using a promotional code as offered on the Citibank website for a {$400.00} credit toward my checking account once the account was funded with {$15000.00}, I opened a checking account on XX/XX/XXXX and deposited {$15000.00}. According to communications from Citibank the {$400.00} promotional code was to be applied to my account no later than XX/XX/XXXX which is 90 days after the initial 30 days XXXX 120 days total ). I have contacted Citibank several times and all the customer service reps have explained that the promotional code should appear on my account soon. Citibank has not lived up to their end of the bargain and continue to tell me that the complaint has been escalated to the promotional department but we should just allow them time to complete my eligibility. They already have verified my eligibility and wrote me that I qualified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "240587   A check was presented twice for cash my check # XXXX from Citibank was presented and paid on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and a second time on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX over a year later. I opened a case with CITI but want to also let you know that this is happening. This is obviously Fraud. my questions to the Citi Rep was 1. how does a check over a year old paid? \\r\\n2. why is the same check paid twice? \\r\\nno responses to either. Last years check should have been destroyed after payment by the bank I suspect. Meanwhile the bank is not refunding the funds and starting an investigation. so I 'm down in {$330.00} due to their negligence to identify fraud                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "241560   Citibank advertised a special promotion for their Citigold product. It required a minimum deposit. \\r\\n\\r\\nI already had a checking and a savings account with Citi. I added additional funds to the savings account to achieve the threshold amount. In exchange, I was to receive the added benefits of the Citigold product. \\r\\n\\r\\nUnbeknownst to me, Citi opened a new checking account tied to Citigold. Since I did n't know this account existed, no money was placed in this account. Since no money was placed in this account, it was below the threshold. Citi began charging fees. \\r\\n\\r\\nI was able to have this reversed and shut the account. However, I think it is important to communicate to the CFPB that Citibank continues to employ deceptive practices even after it has paid heavy fines and made changes to management. Very disappointing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "242013   I submitted an application for an account with Citibank on the understanding that I would be eligible for a promotion with XXXX XXXX upon completing certain hurdles. \\r\\nI completed said hurdles, and contacted them XXXX XXXX as to why I had n't received the promotional miles. They stated they would open a case and look into it. I contacted them again XXXX XXXX, and I was told I would have an answer in XXXX to two business days. I contacted them again XXXX XXXX, and was put on hold via their chat system indefinitely ( disconnected approximately 3 hours after the rep said it would be just a few minutes ). I contacted them again today and they said that I was n't eligible despite fulfilling the hurdles. I 've also incurred a {$30.00} fee during my wait for them to act, which they said they would n't waive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "242019   The complaint described herein is centered towards Citibank not advising of ATM fees at the point of transaction, and not necessarily about the fees themselves per se. \\r\\nCitibank uses their ATM terminals at many, if not all, XXXX convenience stores in this area. The ATM is clearly marked as \" Citibank '' and is furtherly recognizable as such by their corporate logo. Citibank also co-markets actively with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, of which this writer has been member of since 2009. \\r\\nOn many occasions, I 've used my XXXX card at the Citibank ATM terminals at various XXXX stores. Never, not even once, did the Citibank ATM prompt a warning about fees incurred by use of an XXXX card at their terminal, which reasonably leads one to assume that there are no fees. \\r\\nI believe this a deliberate act, a deceit by omission. For example, when I tried my XXXX and XXXX cards, the Citibank terminal display will promptly, and quite correctly, apprise me of the imminent usage fees incurred by both Citibank and the card issuer, at which point I 've always declined. \\r\\nIn all, I 've been relieved of approximately {$50.00} ( {$2.00} withdrawal and {$.00} inquiry fee ) in unsuspected fees in just the last month. My investigation is ongoing back to when I joined XXXX in 2009, which may be more or less that stated amount, but it 's entirely plausible that I 've lost approx. $ XXXX {$700.00} dollars a year for the last 7 years that I 've been a member of XXXX , which I only discovered serendipitously while checking my account relating to another matter.

       "242020   I signed up for a Citi Gold account online and entered promotion code XXXX. where I would receive XXXX XXXX XXXX bonus miles points after completing certain requirements. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I received a letter from Citibank confirming that that the promotion offer is attached to my application and confirming that I would receive eligible for the bonus. This lead me to finalize the application and agree to open this premium account. I 've since completed the requirements to receive the bonus and I have kept XXXX with Citigold account so that I am not charged with monthly fees associated with the account. \\r\\nA follow up email and phone call with Citibank confirmed that the previously stated requirements were met. Citibank sent me an email on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX stating that I have meet ALL the requirements for the promotion and have asked me to wait for 30-90 days for the points to added to my AA accounts. Now, after confirming this promotion was applied to my account, confirming that I had met the requirements, and confirming that the points would be deposited, Citi has not add the AA bonus miles points to my AA account. I believe Citibank is behaving on unethical business practices by not fulfilling their end of a business agreement and purposefully and/or negligently misleading customers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

I check my account on a daily basis and these fees are coming out of nowhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "255343   On XXXX XXXX, 2016 I discovered that a series of unauthorized withdrawals have been done on my account with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. These withdrawals go all the way from XXXX XXXX up to XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$2000.00}. I have attached a snapshot of transactions from my account. \\r\\nI tried to report this immediately to the bank by calling them the minute I noticed this ; however, as it was a Saturday, they 're answering service could not do much but take my message and refer me to their XXXX XXXX service whom I discussed my situation. \\r\\nOn Monday, XXXX XXXX, I spoke to XXXX from Member Services who instructed me to file disputes and claims on these transactions. She also told me that under Federal Regulations, I can only dispute up to 60 days out from the time of my claim. As such, they were only able to recover all but {$350.00} of fraudulent withdrawals. \\r\\nLater, XXXX called me to explain to me what they are doing and that as she said earlier can only recover transactions within the last 60 days. They said that I should discuss my situation with Citibank as these amounts are outside the 60 days window for disputes. XXXX also explained to me that these may not be fraudulent transactions but possible an error on the part of the other party who happens to bank with the XXXX XXXX also and has the same digits in their account no. except for the last XXXX which could have been transposed inadvertently. \\r\\nI said that, regardless these are unauthorized transactions and should be reversed especially the fact that the other party banks with them and therefore they have reign over that account and this entire incident for that matter. She said however, there are regulations and that Citicard needs to be the XXXX to reverse such transactions which was the same way the other transactions were treated except for the first or early transactions which apparently are being ignored. \\r\\nI tried reaching someone at Citicard and Citibank for two weeks who could help me. I was thrown around as no one knew how to handle such a case. So everyone I talked to said that it is my bank who should deal with this on my behalf. \\r\\nSo, as you can see, I 'm in the middle of this being thrown back and forth between these XXXX banks. \\r\\nI am filing a complaint on XXXX XXXX XXXX for not resolving this issue that is just, and washing their hands off by using a technicality under supposed Federal Regulations law ; furthermore, for not having the proper accounts system to prevent such an error like this, if it is, to protect their client-members. \\r\\nI want to also file a complaint against Citibank/Citicard for ignoring my calls regarding this matter and for taking my case lightly. I had sent them a letter based on an address I was given by their customer service, and have yet to hear from them. With that letter is a copy of the credit union 's request to Citicard to address the transactions that occurred in XXXX, which according to them Citicard had ignored or have not responded to at all. I 'm also attaching that letter here. They are as much responsible for not ensuring such a fraudulent use of other people 's account and for failing to correct this appropriately given the evidence that these are fraudulent transactions. \\r\\nWhether there is a 60 day dispute window or not, such should not be an excuse to avoid correcting what truly are unauthorized transactions. What this incident implies is that we can not completely rely on banks to keep our monies safe without us having to check on it from time to time. This is a disgrace! \\r\\nPlease help me recover my savings. \\r\\nThank you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "255852   Hello, My husband and I opened accounts with Citibank pursuant to a promotional offer to receive XXXX miles. When I first applied, I was assured via a written communication that I qualified for the promotion and needed only to meet certain requirements. After meeting those requirements I was assured that I would receive the miles - again by a written communication. \\r\\n\\r\\nLater, however, I received a third communication that informed me that I would not be receiving the promotion they had already promised me twice, but instead that I no longer qualified. I asked Citibank to look into this, and a month later received the same communication that I did not qualify. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is all despite the fact that I received written assurances that the promotion applied to my account and that it would be honored. Citibank lured me into opening an account with them only to have them take back their promotional offer without warning and only AFTER promising me miles. Completely unacceptable. There is another word for it as well ... Fraud.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "255856   I opened a new citigold checking account around XXXX XXXX of 2016 using a promotion code XXXX upon which I was to receive XXXX XXXX XXXX rewards points upon completing certain requirements. I received confirmation twice that I was successfully enrolled in the promotion and after completing all the requirements I received confirmation from a XXXX XXXX dated XXXX/XXXX/2016 at citibank confirming not only was I enrolled in the promotion but also that I had completed successfully every requirement to obtain the bonus miles. I was told they should post by statement close XXXX/XXXX/2016. When they had not posted by XXXX/XXXX/2016 I emailed customer service following up on the matter and to my dismay they contradicted all prior information stating I was not eligible for this promotion ( even though they gladly accepted my money and confirmed that I was enrolled in the promotion and had completed all requirements ). This is unfair practice and I would like the bonus miles that I was confirmed I qualified for, especially considering the fact that they have now taken {$90.00} in monthly service fees out of my account. Please help me get Citibank to stand up and honor their word. They should be required to honor all promotions that they allow consumers to sign up for and participate in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "255861   I received an off from Citibank in XX/XX/XXXX ( offer XXXX ) that offered XXXX AA miles if I opened a Citigold bank account and met certain spending criteria which I met. I received a message in XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX confirming that I met all of the criteria and that the XXXX miles would be credited in XX/XX/XXXX. That never occurred. When I sent a message today, XXXX XXXX responded that, despite her prior email, I was not targeted for the promotion and would receive the XXXX miles even after confirming that I would receive them. The fact is that I did receive an offer being a Citibank credit card holder. I fell that this is a bait and switch scam and in bad faith. Please investigate this fraudulent offer and help with a resolution. Thank you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "255865   Hello, I opened a Citi Gold Checking account XX/XX/2015 per the terms of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX miles promotion. XXXX code : XXXX. I have yet to received the miles posted to my account and it is well past the deadline. Citi bank is being unresponsive. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, I had completed the requirements of the promotion. In XX/XX/XXXX, after not receiving my miles, I reached out to Citibank via phone to see why I had n't received my points. They confirmed that I had met all of the requirements of the promotion and should receive my miles within 30 days. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, I had not received my points so I called again and they said that I needed to complete a XXXX in order to receive the miles. They mailed me one and I immediately filled it out and returned. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, I still had not received my points so I call again and requested to speak with a supervisor. The supervisor confirmed that I had completed the requirements of the promotion but that they needed my XXXX XXXX Advantage #. I provided the number and they stated that I would receive the miles within 30 days. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn XX/XX/XXXX I received an email stating that Citi had closed my account without permission and I still had not received my miles. \\r\\n\\r\\nI feel that I have been scammed by Citi because I completed all of the necessary requirement and had that confirmed by multiple people at Citi, yet they have not followed through on their end of the deal. Then, they have closed my account, I suspect in an attempt to not have to give me my miles. I have spent several hours on the phone and on secure messager over this issue.

       "1154798  I opened a checking account with citibank on XXXX XXXX stating that if I deposit $ XXXX I will receive a {$300.00} bonus. It is now XXXX XXXX and I still have n't received it. I have submitted inquiries twice and called to get this cleared up and both times they have denied me and said they either do not have the bonus code on file or that I did n't meet the terms of the bonus. Their explanations have been inconsistent. I have been given XXXX completely different reasons for my denial an each referenced a different bonus program which tells me that they are not being consistent and they are being fraudulent. \\r\\n\\r\\nI am writing you because I have been made aware that Citibank has a history of doing this to customers and they need to be held accountable. I have no reason to just park $ XXXX in an account for them for 4 months. It seems to me that they do this with the hopes of having a free $ XXXX to use as essential an interest free loan for them since they did n't hold up their end of the bargain and apply the {$300.00} bonus. It irks me to no end that I have been given the run around by them for over a month now and I will be canceling my account with them and ensuring others do the same.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "1154803  XXXX XXXX sent me a {$40.00} reimbursement check on XXXX XXXX, 2016. I notified them to mail me a check since Citibank account was closed.

       "1154824  Dear CPFB, At this point I feel as though I have no other choice than to involve a third party in order to get Citibank to cooperate with me and listen to my valid complaints. First and foremost, I have what was supposed to be a free checking account that I 've held for almost fifteen years without incident, but now almost never use. There appears to be many fees from Citibank attached to this so-called free checking account that I do not understand. Furthermore, when the account for some reason despite almost never being used became overdrawn, perhaps in part due to these mystery fees from Citibank, Citibank did NOT notify me. Instead, they allowed my overdraft account to become totally exhausted, in order to charge me additional interest and fees on the account, that much is clear, but rather than call me when this occurred, they sent me a letter which looked like an ordinary statement rather than call me. Citibank has claimed in said letter that they no longer have my contact information, even though none of it has changed in over ten years. This is either false on the part of Citibank, or it shows extreme incompetence in terms of their record keeping. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe most egregious part, is that even though I sent a certified letter to my branch begging them to please call me to answer my questions, they have ignored my request and instead reported my as DELINQUENT to the major credit bureaus. Without one phone call, and I have banked there for almost 15 years! I have very good credit, pay my bills on time, and have never been delinquent on a payment in my life, yet Citibank who I believe has a lot of explaining to do to ME in terms of this account has RUINED my hard earned credit. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis should not be allowed to happen. They should be investigated and they should provide me with the answers I am seeking. I can only wonder how many others may be getting treated like this by a major financial institution who seems to think they have no accountability whatsoever to their customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nRegards, XXXX                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "1154864  I opened a Citigold Checking account with Citibank on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX after receiving the promotion code XXXX. The requirements for this promotion were to open a Citigold checking account, make one bill pay transaction for two consecutive months, and make {$1000.00} in purchases via the debit card. Upon completion of the promotion requirements, I would receive XXXX XXXX XXXX. I thought this was a great promotion as I am a long-time Citibank XXXX credit card customer ( since XX/XX/XXXX ) as well as a Citibank customer ( since XX/XX/XXXX ). Citibank opened my Citigold Checking Acct in early XXXX XXXX. I promptly deposited funds and began working to satisfy the promotion requirements. I completed the bill payments on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I completed the {$1000.00} in debit card purchases on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Following completion of the requirements, I contacted Citibank customer services and was informed that I had met the requirements and the miles would be post XXXX statements after the period in which I met the requirements. Given the requirements were completed in XXXX and the XXXX statement closed on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I expect the miles to post XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX. After not receiving the XXXX AAdvantage miles by XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a message to Citibank via the messaging function on their website on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Citibank promptly replied on XXXX XXXX and indicated they would review the issue. After several weeks I received a letter from Citibank on XXXX XXXX, XXXX indicating that after investigation they determined that I was not actually eligible for the promotion. This contradicts information previously provided to me by Citibank customer service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "1154868  Citibank sent several to text to my Cell phone without my consent. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received XXXX texts to my phone number XXXX from the Citibank fraud department inquiring about a fraudulent transaction with my debit card in West Virginia. The online account ( opened in XXXX or XXXX ) was not compromised so there was no need to change the user name or password. I had conversations with Citibank on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and I asked numerous representative how did they receive consent to send texts to my cell phone. Citibank had sent text prior to this incident. I asked them to send me a letter stating when they received consent. On XXXX XXXX I received my new debit card and attempted to add it to my online account. I was able to access the account with my old user name and password. I needed to add the new debit card number to the account and it should have provided me with full access. ( The usual process is to add the new debit card number to the online account and I have full access. ) I was able to access the account but with limited access because the new debit card could not be added. The rep went through several trouble shooting steps and said I needed to register for a new account to access my current account. I asked why and she said it was to access the account. I was asked to add a new user name and password and to accept new terms of agreement and I cancelled at that point. \\r\\nI have been able to access my account with the old user ID and password with limited function under my old user name and password up until Monday XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Today I was told my old user ID and password were no longer active because I set up a new user name and password which I did not. The system indicates that the terms of agreement have to be accepted for a new account to be used or setup. The rep said that the system must have pushed it through without my consent. \\r\\nI am no longer able to access my online account. Since I started to inquire about who gave Citibank authorization to send text to my cell phone. I have had difficulty accessing my account to pay my bills and access my balance. Now I am told that I set up a new user ID and Password and this was pushed thru the system. I was told that I provided consent and to check my account yesterday, to receive text and now I am unable to access my account to verify this information and they refused to provide the date that I supposedly consented. Citibank is preventing me from accessing my online account which is linked with my savings, checking and credit card account. If a new online account was established with a new user name and password then it done without my permission.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "1154870  I am complaining about my experience at the Citibank branch on XXXX XXXX in XXXX. I visited the branch with my mom to check our checking and saving accounts, but we were told that my mom 's checking and saving accounts were closed due to inactivity. To even more of a shock, we found that her account was deducted monthly service fees for years while she was abroad until the point that Citibank decided to close her account and report unclaimed property to the State of California. \\r\\n\\r\\nI acknowledge that it is her fault not updating her address, but there is a contact number and email on file. If Citibank did exert a minimal level of due diligence, they could have easily reached her without having to resort to this action. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs we met with XXXX XXXX XXXX, the Branch Manager, not only did he act like he was not able to help but also show contempts towards us! He said : \" when your mom went back to XXXX, she should update her address. We have so many international clients, and we can mail her statements internationally. '' First of all, we are not from XXXX - he judged us based on our races/appearance. Second, we already acknowledged that we did not update the address, so what is the point of repeatedly mentioning this without really addressing the problem. He then went on to say \" we only have your mailing address on file, so that is the only way we can contact her, '' but he later found out that a phone number and email address were clearly listed in the profile. He was not actively trying to resolve our problem, and instead just beat around the bush to ridicule us. He did not show empathy to what has happened to us, and made jokes about there are people like us too by saying \" there customers who thought they have their vacation money, but only to find out their money is gone. ( laugh from the manager ) '' I think XXXX XXXX XXXX was not behaving in the manner that I would expect from a customer service perspective. He was demeaning and showed contempts to customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nI hope you can seriously address this issue, because I am now very upset about Citibank 's lack of due diligence in verifying accounts of inactivity, deducting service charges without notifications, closing accounts without verification, and also the unprofessional demeanors of XXXX XXXX XXXX. Thank you for your attention.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "1154881  I opened checking and saving accounts at Citibank on the phone. The rep said to expedite the matters to go to the branch, present ID, sign necessary forms and deposit the money. So I did. A week later it turned out they were missing a copy of my ID I presented in the branch. But they kept quiet until I called them on the phone asking about access to my money. Eventually they sent me an email with a form for ID copy so I had to fax the image of my ID with the form. After that they sent me an ATM card. But when I registered it I discovered that the access to the savings with the entire amount ( XXXX ) of the deposit is blocked. Now they are stating that they do not have the signature card which is a lie. Without it the opening of the account would not have been complete and accepting the deposit would not be possible. Even written communication with customer service is infuriating. They completely ignore what is stated in the request and give absolutely irrelevant answer. At this point I worry about a very substantial amount of my money that they are holding and refusing access with made up reasons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "1154925  I am writing to complain that I have a basic checking account with Citibank for the past 5 years and they have been offering this thank you points program which my account is not even eligible for. I even have a thank you points account. I was told by the thank you points online chat that I would need to speak a customer service agent on the bank account side. I proceeded to do so and was told by the customer service agent that my account isnt eligible for thank you points since its basic checking. My question is why would you have a consumer who has been a good customer be set up with thank you points account and not give them points nor explain to the customer that they are not eligible yet they have an account for thank you points set up? If you look at the last page of the uploaded documents it says I have XXXX rewards and happily shows me that I have nothing? This does n't make sense?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "1154941  On XXXX XXXX XXXX, a charge for {$430.00} appeared on my checking account from XXXX. I contacted Citibank that day to initiate fraud charges. As of XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Citibank has not resolved this issue. I have made XXXX separate phone calls to them, and faxed them twice. ( Although I first lodged the complaint XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I was not told to fax a written statement until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. ) Citibank representatives constantly reference their attempts to call me, though my phone shows no missed calls, and no messages were ever left.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "1154946  I opened an account with Citibank promising a {$400.00} bonus for depositing {$15000.00} for one month. After {$15000.00} being in my account for three months, not only have I not received the bonus, but I have written five letters to Citibank without receiving the bonus. I also have not received a confirmation that I will receive the bonus. I need to use that {$15000.00} elsewhere. \\r\\nAt this point, I believe i should receive three {$400.00} payments for the bank holding my {$15000.00} for three months and purposely delaying payment through stalling techniques. Please ask them to pay me now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "1154951  I received a letter from Citibank informing me that I could submit a claim to be included in the lawsuit against them regarding their identity theft monitoring product. However, the website address in the letter took me to a page that does not exist. I spent a half hour searching the web and making phone calls trying to find the correct web address. I called Citibank at a number I got from the internet ( there was no phone number in the letter ) at XXXX. The agent there had no idea what I was talking about and gave me the number for the FTC ( XXXX ). They also had no idea what I was talking about, and gave me the number for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I spoke with XXXX, who supplied the correct web address XXXX and I successfully submitted a claim. All of this took 28 minutes. I then spent another 10 minutes filing a complaint with you about the misdirection perpetrated by Citibank in the letter they sent me about filing the claim. All in all, this cost me nearly {$50.00} because my time is worth {$75.00} an hour. \\r\\n\\r\\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

Citibank 's action of closing my account is a breach of contract and law affords remedy or a legal cause of action when a binding agreement ( or bargained-for exchange of consideration ) is not honored.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "1154963  On XXXX XXXX, 2016 and again on XXXX XXXX, 2016, I attempted to open a new, personal CitiGold Interest Checking account. On XXXX XXXX, 2016 their telephone representative told me that my application was accepted and emailed to me a signature card, which I signed and faxed back to them on XXXX XXXX, 2016. Approximately 10 days later, I received by U. S. mail my first Citigold checking account statement, which showed my new account number and account balance. Then XX/XX/2016, I received their letter dated XXXX XXXX, 2016 stating that they did not open this account, claiming they were unable to verify information. \\r\\n\\r\\nUpon phoning them again, they refused to provide any information about what information about me they were unable to verify. They claimed my account was now closed. All representatives I talked to were completely uncooperative and entirely unhelpful about what I could do going forward to re-open this simple checking account. Note that I have been a Citibank credit card customer in good standing for over 10 years, so their bank does have extensive information about me. Also, I was not applying for any form of credit from Citibank. Instead, I was attempting to deposit my money into their bank. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen originally opening this account, I told them that I was applying using Promotion Code = XXXX, which would allow me to receive a {$500.00} cash bonus if I met certain requirements of the promotion. It became clear in talking with their phone representatives that they were trying to not open this account to avoid eventually paying me this {$500.00} bonus. \\r\\n\\r\\nTheir offering this new account opening bonus promotion and then refusing to actually open the account constitutes consumer financial fraud, deceptive marketing practices, and sales misrepresentation. I am requesting that ( 1 ) Citibank re-open my checking account under the terms of the original {$500.00} cash bonus promotion, and ( 2 ) the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate Citibank 's many marketing promotions for all other instances of misrepresentation, fraud, and marketing deception.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

XXXX ) Make a bill payment using the BillPay service for two consecutive months. I met the requirements quickly and awaited my points. After months passed, I launched an investigation into where my points were and was told that I was ineligible. It seems that Citibank had retroactively gone back and decided this offer was limited and targeted only, despite it not saying so in the literature. I feel like this was a bait-and-switch scam designed to get multiple people to sign up for their $ XXXX/mo Citigold checking accounts, without fulfilling their advertised promotion. It has become quite a well know issue, as many people are in the same boat as I.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "1156725  Hi, XXXX people in our household opened up citi checking accounts with a {$400.00} checking account bonus. The promo code was XXXX. We have met all of the requirements and it has been over 2 months since we have met the requirements and no bonus has been put in our accounts. Every time I call in to ask about the bonus they bring up different excuses : we will escalate this to a supervisor, we will investigate, you need to send in XXXX forms, etc.. Citibank has been stonewalling hundreds of customers on this bonus ( I have read of hundreds of others who are having the same problem ).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "1156736  I opened a CitiGold checking account online in XXXX of XXXX. At this time I was already a Citibank customer with an credit card account that earns their 'XXXX Points '. The checking account was opened using a promotional offer that Citi had, which provided a bonus XXXX Points ( worth approximately {$500.00} ) once the following conditions were met : that I make XXXX bill payments in XXXX separate months within 2 months of opening the account. I opened the account, and verified ( via Secure Message and using their Online Chat application ) with Citi that my account was opened using the promotional code, and that I had met the requirements of the bonus. I was told in accordance with the promotional terms that the bonus points will post within XXXX statements or 90 days of completing the requirements, which would have been XXXX XXXX, XXXX. It is now XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and I have paid {$90.00} total in monthly fees to Citi, and Citi has not upheld its side of the promotion. Citi now claims that I was never eligible for the promotion, despite the fact that they confirmed my eligibility several times and provided specific dates and milestones that correlated to that eligibility. This is very unfortunate in that in the seven months this account has been open, numerous Citi reps have confirmed my enrollment in this promotion, eligibility and satisfaction of the promotion requirements to earn the bonus for this checking account. The last Citibank rep I spoke with told me that the points would post within 90 days of meeting the requirements. Only now, after they have collected fees for 90 days of waiting, did Citi decide to inform me that I am not eligible. If I was ineligible, why was I not informed earlier? I understand that Citibank reserves the right to 'target ' specific customers for promotional offers, however, the onus is then also on them screen applicants who apply for their eligibility for said offers. Instead, I was able to open an account under this promotion, and then falsely told multiple times that I would receive a bonus which is now not being honored. Therefore, I find this practice to be very deceptive and would like to file a complaint.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "1156741  Victim of identity theft, numerous accounts opened in my name. Please close account, do not send new cards, and remove account off of all XXXX credit agencies. \\r\\nCitibank was asked to close all accounts in XXXX XXXX, remove all e-mail communications, and continued to send numerous cards and account numbers. All accounts disputed. I opted out of arbitration with Citibank after receiving a letter from them stating it had to be done by XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I sent an Opt Out of arbitration on all accounts on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and received documentation from Citibank that out of XXXX accounts addressed out of XXXX that XXXX account did not meet the criteria for Opt Out because it was received after their deadline, when all were sent on the same day. I have sent FCRA documentation with identity theft report, police report, and documentation of identified Banks that had closed accounts. I received a Collection letter originating from a Citibank account ending in XXXX that was sent XXXX XXXX, XXXX from a XXXX XXXX XXXX. Then, I received a letter from Citibank that was sent regarding the same account that was sent XXXX XXXX, XXXX that stated that if I did not contact them by XXXX XXXX, XXXX the account would go into collection after I had already received a letter from the XXXX XXXX XXXX on the same account. I still get e-mails about accounts I have no idea what they are after requesting no e-mail communication by Citibank. Privacy settings were changed through Citibank when I never initiated anything online. Citibank continues harassment and intimidation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "1156751  I would like to file a formal complaint with your office regarding extremely poor customer service I have received from your customer service department of Citi Priority. As well as your executive response unit with XXXX, who has not returned numerous calls and emails left at his office. \\r\\nXXXX I have been a loyal citibank client since 2007. I currently am a Citi Priority account holder, and have received extremely poor, horrible customer service regarding overdraft fees charged to my account. I am currently residing abroad in XXXX, and travel back and fourth to XXXX frequently. I was recently charged XXXX {$34.00} overdraft fees to my Citi Priority account, for insufficient funds. I have been expecting a payment from one of my clients, which unfortunately was delayed. \\r\\nXXXX I am very unhappy with the very poor, nasty and unprofessional customer service I have received from Citi Priority, regarding my request for both of these fees to be reversed. \\r\\nXXXX I also have tried to open a Citibank savings plus account, but my account has been closed, two days after opening it. this is extremely unprofesssional, and I am really unhappy of the very unprofessional, abusive, horrible service I have been receiving lately. I want this savings plus account ending in XXXX to be immediately reinstated, as it was closed about two days after it was opened. \\r\\n\\r\\nXXXX I would really appreciate a member of your staff to please follow up with me to please immediately remove the block from my savings plus account, and have the account ending in XXXX immediately reinstated. \\r\\nXXXX I have recently started a new career working for XXXX here in their XXXX headquarters of their XXXX offices. I am not sure if you offer any special promotional accounts or offers for XXXX employees, but if there might be any special programs available with Citibank for XXXX employees, I would greatly appreciate any additional information. \\r\\nXXXX Please accept my most sincere apologies in advance for having to be left with no other alternative but to contact your offices. I really appreciate and respect your time, and I look forward to receiving a follow up from a POLITE and PROFESSIONAL member of your executive response team, as I have not received any response to the numerous messages and emails left at XXXX Office.

       "1157363  Last XXXX I received a targeted offer from Citibank for a Citigold account which, after completing the spend requirements, was supposed to result in XXXX XXXX miles in that account. I fulfilled the requirements months ago. One citibank rep said I would get the miles in XXXX, then I was told I had n't turned in a tax form, then I turned it in and Citibank said they never received it. Then they admitted they had received it. I escalated my request at the XX/XX/XXXX and was told I would get the miles by XXXX XXXX. Has n't happened. Talked to Citibank last night and was told that Citibank has \" approved '' the miles but they have no idea when they will be posted or available to me. Meanwhile I have been paying a monthly fee to maintain the Citigold account. Last night the representative said I would n't have to pay any fees for three months, but I 've already paid several months of fees AND I have no miles yet. I kept my part of the deal ; Citibank has not kept theirs. This is fraud. I want the miles, I want the fees rebated for the months since I met the requirements. I think I also deserve some consideration for the hours I have spent on the phone with them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "1157373  I received an offer from Citibank to open a checking account. This offer gave ThankYou XXXX points or XXXX miles based on meeting certain criteria. The criteria was that I open the checking account by XXXX/XXXX/2015, then within 60 days after account opening, I would have to make one bill payment each month for two consecutive calendar months. The account ( s ) must remain in Good standing. The points would be awarded within 90 days after completing those requirements. I have met all of the requirements. In addition, I have called Citi Customer Service seven times since making the requirement. I have spoken to three supervisors and one manager that returned my call. Each of the VERIFIED that I am eligible and I have met all requirements and that I would receive my XXXX points on XXXX XXXX, 2015. I called Citi on XXXX XXXX and was advised that I was not eligible for the points after meeting all requirements, seven phone calls, and $ 30 monthly fee 's ( {$90.00} total ). \\r\\nIf at any time I was not eligible for this program, I should have been advised instead of the deceit and possible Fraud committed by Citi since they continued to bill {$30.00} in monthly fees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "1158302  Hi My name is XXXX XXXX. \\r\\nI`m going through nightmare because of Citibank and their unprofessional customer service. \\r\\nI have Citibank checking account where I was keeping my life savings.I have another checking account with XXXX XXXX where I do my banking and pay my bills.I use this Citibank checking account as saving.I was trusting Citibank and keeping my savings what I have earned in their bank, since they offer me free checking account.Since I was not using that account very often and I had paperless statement I was not constantly aware what is going on in my account.i just was trusting Citibank and would never think that they will let me go through this nightmare what I`m going through now. \\r\\nOne day when my father passed away few months ago and I needed to take money from my account because I had expenses to cover i called my Citibank checking account to check my balance and also find out how much they charge to transfer money to my home country Armenia.When i called first I got surprised when automatic service told me that I have there few hundred dollar available balance, because I knew that I have there around XXXX $ dollar.Then I got little nervous and asked for life representative. \\r\\nWhen I spoke to life rep and asked her where is my money, she told me that the records indicate that I wrote a check for XXXX $ to someone.I got really surprised, upset and frustrated at the same time at that moment, because first of all I never wrote any check to anyone from that account and second of all from the day when I opened that account I never had any checks on that account.I never ordered checkbook.Anyway eventually we find out that I`m a victim of identity theft.There is forgery check and fraudulent activities on my account.At that moment I was in terrible situation, since my father just passed away and I had to go through this everything also.They told me not to worry about this, since I have nothing to do with it, and just go to Citibank branch the next day to close this account and open new one.They also opened the dispute for this transactions, and they promise me to issue conditional credit so I can cover my expenses.Within next few days we did everything what they ask and also sent affidavit of Forgery. \\r\\nAfter almost 2 months I receive letter from Citibank with some none sense unprofessional explanation.That letter says that they denying the reimbursement since the interval between you first notified of the transaction and the date you finally informed Citibank exceeded 30 days.They also mention that Client Manual stated that information, which is false statement.We have client manual and next to that 30 days notice requirement there is highlighted note, that forgery endorsements are exceptions.You can not control identity theft or when you will become a victim.It does not make any sense. \\r\\nAnyway after we receive that letter we called Citi bank several times.Every time we speak to them they politely apologizing and saying something different.One of the reps even told us that they deny the case because they never received the affidavit form.We have tried in 3 different occasions to reopen the case and even done the affidavit in their branch, but even that did not helped.Now they told me that they will again open the investigation, but I don`t trust them anymore.That`s why I need your help. \\r\\nI`m old woman with lots of health problems.And I`m going through nightmare this passed 3 months because of them.We told them many times.Why you never called me to verify such a large transaction before granting it, where is your security??? Why I have to go through all this because of you unprofessional act? In one day I lost all my life savings. \\r\\nPlease help me to get my money back. \\r\\nThis is USA and in this country no one can treat consumers and tax payers like that. \\r\\nThey disrespecting us and discriminating without any reason.                                                                                       \n",

       "1158317  I applied for a checking account ( Citigold ) with Citibank online on or about XXXX XXXX, 2015. Due to glitches with their computer system, I was not able to complete the application for several days. The account fee is {$30.00} a month ( first two months of fees are waived ), and I also submitted a code to obtain XXXX Citibank \" Thank You Points '' upon completion of qualifying activity ( which consists of paying XXXX bills online for XXXX consecutive months ). ( These points would be worth {$520.00} in airline tickets if I booked through Citibank 's travel website, so there is definite value here. ) Yesterday, I received a rejection in the mail. The letter stated that the reason for the rejection was due to information contained in my XXXX credit report. I immediately pulled up the report, reviewed it, and found nothing to warrant the rejection. My credit score, which I obtained from Citibank itself ( which is a service they provide to holders of the Citi XXXX credit card ) is XXXX ( out of XXXX ). Clearly, it looks like the Citibank rejection was just a ruse, and I believe they acted in bad faith by placing the rejection based on information in a credit report which clearly does not support their claim.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "1158709  XX/XX/2015 a promotional advertisement was posted on internet by Citi Bank agent XXXX XXXX XXXX for Citibank Citigold checking to award prospective applicant XXXX bonus miles if the applicant opens a Citibank Checking Citigold Account Package, set up a bill payment for at least 2 consecutive months, and make at least {$1000.00} in debit card purchases.The full text of AD is copied and pasted below.The front page tries to lure customers to Citi Website using the Promotion code below. It does not mention customer must read other disclosures for more terms and conditions.This AD is designed in such a way only to lure and trap customer by giving me XXXX bonus miles as a bate. The AD does not state if you have already existing account you are not eligible, nor does it direct to other pages to read terms and conditions.My question is when I opened account over internet with their promotion code and they knew from their records I have already basic checking account why they did not deny even if I overlooked it. From my standpoint I met all the conditions that they stated on Promotion front page and even Citi representative wrote me I have met all essential conditions so I must get award around XX/XX/XXXX but with latest communication Citi denied.I have copy of that letter too which I can attach or copy paste later. To satisfy their conditions it took me 3 months in my seniors. I consistently was supposed to maintain high balance of {$50000.00} to avoid paying monthly fees. To do that I took money out of my nest egg saving with XXXX XXXX where I got around 1 % interest but interest here is negligible.So I been loser in old age from both sides, thanks to citi bank running these shady promotions. \\r\\nXXXX Citibank Citigold Checking XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Bonus Miles By XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2015 Bank Bonuses Citibank Citigold Checking is offering up to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX bonus miles with promo code XXXX good until XXXX XXXX, 2015.

       "1160448  Citibank issued a prepaid/debit card for a refund from XXXX XXXX after switching service from XXXX XXXX. This refund was issued in my deceased husbands name b/c the account was in his name. The card has been lost/misplaced and is due to expire on XXXX XXXX, 2016. I have contacted Citibank 3 times in an attempt to have the missing card replaced. They have refused to do so without paperwork from an executor. I have explained that there was not an executor of his will as nothing went through probate and faxed them the will ( twice ) to show that all of his possessions were left to me. They have not noted the account as such and say that they have not received the will. I find their refusal to replace the card invalid as the first card was sent out after my husband 's death and feel that they are keeping the money unfairly. I am a XXXX year old widow living on social security and the {$87.00} they are refusing me could supply groceries or other needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "1161929  Citibank has committed fraud against me. \\r\\n\\r\\nHaving admitted as much, they have refused to remedy the situation. \\r\\n\\r\\nCitibank has been deceptive in it 's dealings with me, consistently extremely poor business practices. \\r\\n\\r\\nI opened an account with Citibank, through one of their promotions, which promised to pay me {$400.00} bonus, once I completed all requirements. \\r\\n\\r\\nI completed all requirements on time, but Citibank has thus far refused to paid me my {$400.00} bonus. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs phone records, and case notes with both clearly show, many times I have been assured that my {$400.00} bonus would be deposited into my account, yet it consistently has not been deposited. Many times I have been assured I would receive a call back from Citibank management, who would resolve this for me - however, NOT ONE phone call has come, nor has Citibank EVER followed up on ANY of it 's claims to remedy the situation. \\r\\n\\r\\nI believe I am the victim of fraud, at the hands of Citibank. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe pattern of behavior by Citibank customer service, as well as the erroneous charges posted to my account demonstrates, I believe, a willingness to commit what amounts to fraud. \\r\\n\\r\\nTwo charges were posted to my account fraudulently, by Citibank themselves, but each were removed with separate lengthy calls to customer service, wherein they admitted their \" mistake '' each time in posting fraudulent charges to my account, and were thus obligated to reimburse my account their fraudulent charges. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the requirement for me to receive my {$400.00} bonus was that I maintain a continuous {$15000.00} balance for a set period of time. Citibank used it 's fraudulent debits to my account to disrupt my continued balance during that required time, in what I believe was an attempt to avoid paying me the bonus for which I earned. \\r\\n\\r\\nCitibank has admitted I should have received my bonus by now - I have not. \\r\\nCitibank has assured me that I would receive the bonus by now - I have not. \\r\\nCitibank has assured me, on several different occasions, that I would receive a call from Citibank management - I have not received any calls. \\r\\n\\r\\nI insist that the {$400.00} bonus be immediately deposited into my Citibank account. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf the {$400.00} bonus is not immediately deposited into my account, Citibank will furnish copies of all records and communications between myself an Citibank, including audio copies of all phone calls, to be made available to me to take further legal action. \\r\\n\\r\\nA thorough and comprehensive reading of my account history, by any independent third party or mediator - will clearly demonstrate a pattern of deception on the part of Citibank, I believe, in the attempt to avoid paying me the {$400.00} bonus I am entitled to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "1166592  Citibank Texas NA was sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2015. On XXXX XXXX, 2015 I visited the branch on XXXX XXXX XXXX TX and learned that the bank was being sold. Due to my personal needs and my desired relationship with Citibank I wanted to know how to not have my accounts sold. I was told that I had the right to opt out and was provided a form to sign for that specific purpose. I was not provided a copy of this signed document by the branch employee ( I was in an office not at a teller window ). Part of my relationship with Citibank is access to money via their Citigroup while I am XXXX or not located near a bank. I do not have this option with XXXX XXXX XXXX and knew that I would encounter difficulty accessing my monies. \\r\\nOn XXXX XXXX while logged into my online banking I became aware that my savings account was not showing up. I learned by calling the customer service center that XXXX of my XXXX accounts with Citibank was in fact sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX even though I had signed the opt out. \\r\\nTo date I have spent 15 hours trying to resolve this issue. I have been on the phone to the XXXX response team more than XXXX occasion. The financial hardships, fees and costs related to this event are still accumulating. \\r\\nAs a result of losing my direct deposit savings account - my Citibank account was charged a service charge it had never incurred the entire 4 years of my account. This caused the account to overdraw subsequently causing a NSF reporting to this account. Although Citibank refunded the monies associated to these charges my credit has been marred from its perfect internal status to one of now having a negative reflection. \\r\\nCitibank violated my privacy rights and forced me into a banking relationship that I never wanted. Citibank has now shared my personal financial information to a bank that had no right to ever know or see that information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
